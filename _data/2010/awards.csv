2010,Yes,Angelica Maestes,,,,Adult Education GED Learner of the Year,"Angelica Maestes is the Native American Multicultural Education School (NAMES) student with the record for the longest continual attendance. Although she completed four GED tests within her first year-and-a half at school and was also working full-time and caring for a mentally challenged sibling, she persevered at NAMES to finally master the math test six years later.
