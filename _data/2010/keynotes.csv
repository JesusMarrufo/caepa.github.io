2010,Yes,Helen Thorpe,,,,,,,Denver’s First Lady,"Helen Thorpe is a freelance journalist whose magazine stories have appeared in The New York Times Magazine, New York, George, Westword, and 5280.

Born in London, she grew up in Medford, New Jersey. She has worked as a staff writer for The New York Observer, The New Yorker (“Talk of the Town” stories), and Texas Monthly. She also has produced radio stories that have aired on This American Life and Soundprint.

Thorpe is married to John Hickenlooper, the mayor of Denver, and they have one son. She currently serves on the boards of two non-profit organizations that focus on ensuring the success of all children, particularly those who are growing up in poverty the Clayton Foundation and the Colorado Children’s Campaign.

Her first book, Just Like Us, is a powerful and moving account of four young women from Mexico who have lived most of their lives in the United States and attend the same high school. Two of them have legal documentation and two do not. Just Like Us is their story.

A stunning work of in-depth journalism in the tradition of Random Family, Helen Thorpe’s Just Like Us takes us deep into an American subculture - that of Mexican immigrants - largely hidden from the mainstream. Their situation becomes increasingly painful and complex as the four young women approach adulthood, and the two without legal status watch their two legal friends gain opportunities that are not available to them. All four hold American aspirations, but only two have the documents necessary to realize those hopes.

This brilliant, fast-paced narrative is a vivid coming-of-age story about girlhood, friendship, and, most of all, identity - what it means to fake an identity, steal an identity, or inherit an identity from one’s parents and country. No matter what one’s opinions are about immigration, Just Like Us offers fascinating insight into one of our most complicated social issues today. The girls, their families, those who welcome them, and those who object to their presence all must grapple with the same deep dilemma: Who is an American? Who gets to live in America? And what happens when we don’t agree?
