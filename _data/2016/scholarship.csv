In order to best serve every client, it is so important to stay current with new laws, initiatives, and trends. The CAEPA Rendezvous helps us achieve these goals. And, as a teacher, it is so important to meet and maintain relationships with our peers. I have attended two Rendezvous in the past...one while being the only teacher at my program and one after being newly hired after a lengthy hiatus from the world of Adult Ed. Both times, my mind was opened with the prospect of new possibilities and untapped resources. The workshops give the teachers new tools to help their students, the administration the chance to form new partnerships, and the program the opportunity to continue to provide services to anyone and everyone in need. I have yet to ever leave unfulfilled.

As Colorado has approved, and few testing centers have now implemented, new HSE testing, it is so important for ABE/ASE/GED/HSE instructors to learn about the new tests. I am excited and eager to start teaching for the different tests. I am also just as excited that my students will have options.

I do believe I could still attend, but receiving the scholarship gives us a little flexibility and room to provide a little more in the classroom.",,Yes,Yes,Yes

This is an important distinction and I hope to use the CAEPA conference to help me get on the right side of the learning curve. I've been in the field of ESL for 5 years and am a recent hire for Metro State University’s Family Literacy Program. This philanthropic outreach community outreach program uses ESL as a vehicle to deliver not only English, but computer literacy classes, parenting classes to help be a child’s first teacher, and service learning projects. I hope to take what I learn back to the team to help better integrate my own part of the whole as the academic English teacher. My goal is that each aspect of the program work together smoothly, creating a well-rounded approach of working, interconnected parts and not feel like separately classes that are vaguely related. I am looking for new teaching techniques that directly impact pre-literate learners as well as immigrant and refugee learners. I hope to use the rendezvous as a chance to network and glean advice from veteran teachers who can share their best practices. Unfortunately, my program does not have the funds to send me to this conference and I would be unable to attend without the Ann Deditz scholarship. I will likewise be unable to cover the costs of the rendezvous on my own. Thank you for the consideration, I hope to see you there!","How will receiving the scholarship help in living the mission of your program?, How will you integrate the information from the rendezvous to your program?, Will you be able to attend the rendezvous if you do not receive the scholarship?",Yes,Yes,Yes
