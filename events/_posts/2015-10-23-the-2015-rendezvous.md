Welcome to the 2015 CAEPA Rendezvous! Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to learn, refresh, and connect with colleagues. This conference is about and for you.

When asked to describe the “typical” adult learner, words such as persistent, challenged, overwhelmed, and hopeful are often said. In these shifting times of funding concerns, new partnerships, and change, I task you to take these words used to describe your learners to heart. You as well are persistent in your belief that adult education does matter and can make a difference. You are constantly challenged by multiple constraints including from your learners themselves but know that growth only occurs through effort. You may feel overwhelmed by the  amount of work to be done and the efforts it takes to keep going nonetheless see the long-term benefits. But finally I ask you to remain hopeful in knowing that the steps you are taking along with your learners will make an impact.

We are at a pivotal time in adult education that makes many faint of heart. I ask that you be  brave, be patient, and be connected as we can work together to make the changes that we know will benefit not only our learners but all of Colorado. You do make the difference. Thank you.
