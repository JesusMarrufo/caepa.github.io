Items to consider while watching:

  1.  How can screencast videos assist flipped lessons?
  2.  Can screencast videos bridge a communication gap when assisting others with computer programs, applications, or documents?
  3.  More and more people go to YouTube for learning or help on projects - can you take advantage of this learning style?
  4.  Can your students / customers benefit from the ability to pause or replay a lesson?
