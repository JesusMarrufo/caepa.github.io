Dear COABE Members, 
 
You're invited to participate in a one-of-a-kind Presidential Forum hosted by the [Committee for Education (CEF)](http://cef.org/cef-presidential-forum/) Thursday, May 26 from 9 a.m.- noon. The event will feature high-level policy representatives from the presidential campaigns who will discuss the candidate's education policy platforms and agendas. COABE leadership will be present at this event, and we will be posting updates on our social media outlets #adultedu and #coabenews.  The event is a unique opportunity to hear an in-depth analysis of each candidate's education priorities. Award-winning journalist Candy Crowley will moderate the event and give the audience a chance to ask questions about the need to invest in education and what education policy will look like with a new administration. You are welcome to watch the broadcast live from the Newseum in Washington, D.C.! In addition to watching the livestream, you can participate in the event by submitting your questions for the speakers at SubmitQ@cef.org or tweeting your question using #CEFpresForum. We hope you can join the critical conversation and find out about each of the candidate's education policy platforms in the 2016 race for the White House!

Sincerely, 

Tom Nash, President
Sharon Bonney, Executive Director
Polly Smith, Public Policy Chair
